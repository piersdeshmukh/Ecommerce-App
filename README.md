# Ecommerce-App

# Description

Welcome to the project! This is an Ecommerce app made using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). It allows users to browse, buy, and sell products online. With this app, users can access a variety of products from different categories, such as clothing, electronics, books, and more. They can also create their own listings, manage their orders, and review their purchases. I hope you shop and look forward to your contributions!
